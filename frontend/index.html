        Garbage in, garbage out, what a beautiful symphony. Many people blame
        computers for things that go wrong, but the beauty of computers is that
        they are as neutral as neutral can be.

        Connect a wire wrongly during setup? Yeah, I won’t come on. Forget to
        backup or save? Yeah, that’s your problem, not mine. Miss a semi-colon ?
        Yeah, I won’t run either. How frustrating yet humbling — a rookie
        mistake nonetheless. A computer program is like a mirror, you get
        basically what you give it. It’s like a parrot that simply repeats what
        it hears and reveals the heart and mind of the programmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s the logic errors that hurt the most. Those moments when you may
        feel like you’re just not enough or smart enough, don’t worry; everybody
        has them. Therein lies the power of community.

        Every programmer can agree with the power of community. Your humble,
        lap-sized neutral friend is just revealing to you to the plain truth:
        that you don’t know it all. You couldn’t possibly remember it all, could
        you ? You couldn’t possibly have a panoramic view of the whole world of
        computing from the 19th century until now. In an age where information
        doubles

          >nearly every 12 hours</a
        >, this is even more profound. So take that pick-me-up and ask for help;
        ask that colleague who seems to understand it better; ask in that group,
        and don’t feel stupid for doing so. Someone can see outside the black
        box you're in; someone is waiting at the valley's apex with smiles and
        good news from the other side:

        though; everyone must learn to face their own challenges. Enjoy
        challenges; they are your bread. They nourish you and make you better at
        what you do. The brain loves challenges and grows by solving them, so
        don’t starve your brain. Always remember, like Obi-Wan Kenobi, you have
        the higher ground (cue the Star Wars Jedi theme).

        Art is truly universal, and viewing computing as an art, the same can be
        said for it. Everyone is an innate techie; it’s all about perception and
        consciousness. It's similar to how you would approach anything new: you
        learn how to use it, make some mistakes, and then ask someone who knows
        how to do it better than you to assist you (see... community).
      </p>

      <p>
        The same applies to tech; all you need to do is avoid the

        and you’ll be fine. Technology is advancing at an outstanding rate, and
        we must all harness our innate technological skills to avoid being left
        behind.

        , DApps and DeFi are coming, and you’ll have to join them because you
        definitely won’t be on the 'beating' side. Your future tech-inclined
        self will thank you for taking this bold step to become a bird with
        wings spread in the fiercely blowing wind of technological advancement.
        So let go of your non-technical tether and soar on the beautiful winds
        of computing.
